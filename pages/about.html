        <hr>
        <br>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Education? Who is it that we call 'Educated'? Most of all, what is Education's purpose?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>These questions have been revolving around for as long as one could remember. One might infer from the numerous schools in Addis, the Capital, that these questions have been dealt with. The contrary seems to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quality and effectiveness of the Ethiopian educational system have been stagnant for many years now. The voice of students seem to be undermined. Yet, we know that a real change must be forged WITH and not FOR them. Then where is it that students
            can fully express themselves?
        </p>

        <p>
            Favoring the grown ups, the social system in Ethiopia has given less priority for children. Starting from non-inclusive spaces and systems to national plans and goals, children are nearly excluded. This problem_the Spacelessness_lasted for several years.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common to see tall buildings being built on the neighborhood's football fields. Condominiums tend to prioritize lounges and bars than children's spaces. The movies, theatre and music seem to forget this fact. Safe streets, construction of play grounds
            and fair allocation of resource for all age groups are barely talked about.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a "banking-model" of education that takes away students' voices, and in a social system that often undermines children, where is it that children get to have a say?
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 30px;">OPEN PAGES</span> is a student-initiated educational project that experiments to bring about the ideal and better educational system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our way of experimenting is by providing spaces for children, and working with them on different issues. OPEN PAGES' first branch is at Lebawi International Academy, where we built a children's story books library with spaces for music, painting and games.
            We also host events with children, on which they express their stands on different issues and work together with their peers to create solution for existing problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to create more spaces where children can INTERACT, REFLECT AND BECOME BETTER. It is about time that we enable them to actively participate in what's going on in their world. We must always understand that children are not only the hopes of tomorrow,
            but also the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citizens of today.</span>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">In 2019, Nathnael Nigussie, OPEN PAGES' Founder ,had been part of the Yale Young African Scholars Program in Ghana.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            "...probably, that is the one time I saw the image of the ideal eduactional system. Students from different parts of Africa had been there. It was a true African experience. We discussed, debated and learnt about Africa, its challenges, and the probable
            solutions. It was like we, the students, had our own voice and that it mattered- something we had not been told back in school."
        </p>
        <h5>
            Coming back from YYAS, Nathnael had been introduced to the idea of educational project and that it could indeed make a visible impact.
        </h5>
        <p>
            "...yes! That's when I came up with OPEN PAGES social Impact Project. I had been a bible-school teacher of children for about 2 years then. I thought that we can benefit our community more if we did the educational project and providing children's spaces,
            jointly. It proved to work out, and we owe most of that to our school that encouraged and supported us all the way."
        </p>

        <h5>Following this, our first branch at Lebawi International Academy came into existence.</h5>

        <p>"...What we thought was what can be done, somehow."</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-center">The Process</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">The idea was supported by all who heard it, but the execution was the "unventured way" for all of us. "Where to begin?!"</h4>
        <h5>
            '20 Children Minutes' was a one-week program in which we prepared a 20 minutes per day session for all interested students. We discussed about the problems children faced these days, the educational and social systems. That was our way of recruiting students
            who had a deep interest in what we wanted to do.
        </h5>
        <p>
            "...As we were all students, we had faced many challenges. Financially, we had no way of buying the materials needed. Transportation costs to come on the weekends and material costs required were major obstacles."
        </p>
        <p>
            "From what I remember, execution was the challenging part. We plan to come on weekends and our parents refuse. We plan to do something and we get house chores assigned that day. Shortly, our age! I sometimes wonder how much we could have accomplished
            if we were grown ups..."
        </p>
        <h5>
            Right after recruiting, building the space was the next step. As we did not have any story books, stationary materials or equipment of any kind, we were not ready.
        </h5>
        <p>
            "...what we decided to do was to have a little reading corner at our school, just for students and not actual children. The purpose was to get resources until we were ready. Now that I think of it, it also helped us convince our school that we were committed
            to the work."

            "Our first story book was 'ንጉሡ አንበሳ' (the story of the Lion King). So yeah, we started with that book, one shelf, a mat and some chairs. But through time, donations began to come. Books, colors, games....... We started to grow."
        </p>
        <p>
            " ...our corner gave service for a month. Right after the first week, it almost had become 'the spot' for the students. They read story books, drew and played there. Though our first idea of serving children had not started, we at least were serving our
            peers."
        </p>
        <h5>
            Seeing our progress, the school gave us a place in the basement to build the actual children's space.
        </h5>
        <p>
            "Transforming the basement into a children's colorful space was one of the tiresome works we had!..."
        </p>
        <h5>
            Right around the month of December, 2019, our school had given the students a Christmas break for three weeks.
        </h5>
        <p>
            "...paint!paint!paint! That 3-weeks break was our chance. We made the most out of it! Reading corner, events corner, painting, music, games corners,....you name it! That surely is a good start!"
